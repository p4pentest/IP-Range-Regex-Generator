# IP-Range-Regex-Generator
ShellScript

This a shell script which will fetch the regex for any IP range.

For Example :

If IP Range is :
19.16.46.20 - 19.18.54.45

Output :
19\.(1[6-8])\.((4[6-9])|(5[0-4]))\.(([2-3][0-9])|(4[0-5]))

Please add all the IP range in a particular file and then run the script.
When prompted for the file name, you can either give only the file name if it is in the same folder as the script or the full path for the file.

Share n enjoy !
